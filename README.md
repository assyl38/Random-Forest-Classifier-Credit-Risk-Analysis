# Random-Forest-Credit-Risk-Analysis
## Introduction:
In this project we be able to predict if a person's loan application should be approved or not.

## What is Credit Risk?
Credit risk is the risk of loss that may occur from the failure of any party to abide by the terms and conditions of any financial contract, principally, the failure to make required payments on loans due to an entity.

## What Factors are Used to Assess Credit Risk? </br>
In order to assess the credit risk associated with any financial proposal, the project finance division of the firm first assesses a variety of risks relating to the borrower and the relevant industry. </br>

The borrower credit risk is evaluated by considering: </br>

- The financial position of the borrower, by analyzing the quality of its financial statements, its past financial performance, its financial flexibility in terms of the ability to raise capital, and its capital adequacy
- The borrower’s relative market position and operating efficiency
- The quality of management, by analyzing its track record, payment record, and financial conservatism </br>


Industry-specific credit risk is evaluated by considering: </br>
- Certain industry characteristics, such as the importance of the industry to the economic growth of the economy and government policies relating to the industry
- The competitiveness of the industry
- Certain industry financials, including return on capital employed, operating margins, and earnings stability
 

## How are Credit Ratings Used?
After conducting an analysis of the specific borrower’s risk, the credit risk management group assigns a credit rating to the borrower. Generally, firms accept a scale of ratings ranging from AAA to BB (varies from firm to firm) and an additional default rating of D. Credit ratings are the critical input for the credit approval process, as they help the firm to determine the desired credit risk, spread over its cost of funds, by considering the borrower’s credit rating and the default pattern corresponding to the credit rating.
</br>
Every proposal for a facility is reviewed by the appropriate industry specialists in the credit risk management group before being submitted for approval to the appropriate approval authority. Generally, the approval process for non-fund facilities is similar to that of fund-based facilities.

 

## How Frequently are Credit Ratings Assessed?
Credit rating for every borrower is reviewed at least annually and is typically reviewed on a more frequent basis for high credit risks and large exposures. Generally, the ratings of all borrowers in a particular industry are also reviewed upon the occurrence of any significant event impacting the industry.

Working capital loans are generally approved for a period of 12 months. At the end of the 12 month validity period, the loan arrangement and the credit rating of the borrower are reviewed and the firm makes a decision on continuation of the arrangement and changes in the loan covenants that may be necessary.

## Random Forest Classifier

A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap=True (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree.
